# ðŸ“† Cybersecurity + Python Monthly Project Tracker

This file helps me stay on track by completing **1 small but meaningful project each month**, while still making smaller updates weekly when possible.

### âœ… How to Use This Tracker
- Keep this file updated each month
- Aim to make **at least one commit per month** (even if small)
- Donâ€™t skip `projects.md` updates â€” they show reflection and learning
- Use `notes.md` for commands, lessons, and quick references

> Progress is better than perfection. Even one quality project a month will add up to a powerful portfolio.
